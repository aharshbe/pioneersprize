# 08.03.2022
* 8 Mar 2022 | 3P Roadmap/next steps
* Attendees: pioneersprizecurator@parity.io

## Agenda
* Review Administrative Curator: First order of business review doc

## Context:
* The main ask of this meeting is to asynchronously add your feedback via comment to the “Talking points” section of the doc here
* Discussion outlines the conversation/suggestions that were presented in the meeting
* Yellow Determination means talking point is ready for feedback
* Comment with feedback you have, I will collate all the feedback at the end of the week and update the Determination color red to reflect “finalization” once a consensus is reached
* Red Determination means no feedback is required and the talking point is finalized

## Notes
* Facilitator should still be Parity at least for the next couple months
  * Documentation
  * Polkadot wiki
  * Separate GitHub
  * GitHub pages that link to Pioneers Prize website, separate what is internal and external
* Website launch
  * Tentative for early May
  * Website available in the US
  * Block US IP but not contestants
* Set up meeting for challenge criteria
  * Depending how asynchronous goes
* Goal of the Pioneers Prize
  * Two goals: 1 is to get cool new common-good stuff, 2 get teams interested
  * Raise interest in the treasury and promote it as a source of funding
  * Common good protocol for parachins
* What about publicity
  * The feeling is that the technical side is more important
  * Question around timing
